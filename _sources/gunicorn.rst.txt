Running a Data Provider with gunicorn
=====================================

.. note::

    Functionality added in v0.2.4, this should be used in preference to the local SSL dev version described elsewhere
    where possible, it's reasonably easy to run quickly and also suited for more production-grade use.

`gunicorn <https://gunicorn.org/>`_ is a lightweight Python WSGI HTTP server for linux and other Unix-like operating
systems. This module includes support for running a |FAPI| compliant `Data Provider` within gunicorn, through the
`ClientAuthApplication` custom application class.
